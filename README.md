# MadLib Story Maker
A simple program that reads a story template from a txt file, and replaces all the words marked with <>. For example,
"My <animal> walked down the street" could become "My snake walked down the street"


This mini project was built when I just started learning java. I always used to do MadLib books as a kid, so I thought
it would be a fun thing to program and develop my skills accordingly.
